# Object-Detection-using-Support-vector-machines
This project focuses on classification of objects by training of data using support vector machines
The dataset used for training is Caltech 101
The code was majorly designed for detection of faces and airplanes in the provided images, Although it can be altered as per requirement.

# Dataset
15 images of both faces and airplanes were used to train the svm model

# Code
The code is the most basic code for training of svm for object recognition and detection
